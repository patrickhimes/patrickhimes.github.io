<div>After 16 years of professional experience in application development, I've decided to pursue my life-long dream of becoming a game developer. What interests me most about game development is the chance to create interactive experiences through game mechanics. I look forward to the challenge of boiling a game idea down to its most basic elements and then turning those elements into playable mechanics that are, at their core, simple, and yet build upon each other to create a complex system.</div>

<div>I thrive in small companies where individuals are required to perform multiple skill sets and enjoy taking on new challenges. I also love the closeness of such companies, because I find that it promotes good teamwork, communication, and camaraderie.</div>

<div>While I may be new to this professional field, I am not new to game development. In my free time, I have studied and worked with some of the latest technology, including the Oculus Rift, Unity, Blender, and iOS. Please check out my portfolio for examples of my work.</div>
